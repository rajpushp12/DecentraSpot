### Distinctiveness and Complexity
It has been quite a time since I've started this project. I'm glad to be able to complete this at the expected date.

Figuring out the nature of this application has been a tough call, I thought of making a food delivery based app but that again has become common these days so I had to drop the idea. Further, it came to mind that most of the bank websites crash a lot, why not make a better one for them? This induced the thought of the hottest investments of all time,**the cryptocurriencies**.
